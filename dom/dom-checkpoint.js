// 1. Select the **second** h1 element and console.log it.


// 2. Select the paragraph with a class of "excerpt" and change its class name
// to "snippet".


// 3. console.log the number of todo items in the todo-list.


// 4. Write the code such that each time the #n4 div is is clicked, its
// "red" class gets toggled (ONLY the "red" class; "rect" should remain).


// 5. Loop over all the .done-list items and log their text to the console.


// 6. Write the code such that each time the box-mover button is clicked, the
// .box div moves to the right by 10px.


// 7. Using event delegation with the click event handler on the
// .counter-container element, increment the count by the clicked button's
// associated value (data attribute). When the count reaches 75 or more, show
// the .counter-done element. Use the browser devtools' Element inspector to
// figure out which CSS property to use to toggle the visibility of the
// .counter-done element.
